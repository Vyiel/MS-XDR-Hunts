Hello World!

This is a growing collection of my daily struggles as a CTH analyst which I am opensourcing for public use and for myself in the future.
It consists of KQL queries, specifically crafted and engineered to be executed on Microsoft's XDR's advanced hunting platform. PS. Will not work from Sentinel Logs by default, although can be modified to do so.

These queries have come up after multiple and vigorous testing by running them offences from a lab and analyzing the noise made by them in MS XDR.

Note: I can easisly be wrong or somewhat wrong in my queries and if you can comeup with a fix, please feel free to collaborate. At the end of the day, it's just knowledge sharing.

Thanks.
